 # Road-Accident-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective 
The Road Accident Data Analysis project is to identify key factors influencing road accidents and uncover trends related to accident frequency and severity. The project aims to provide data-driven insights and recommendations for improving road safety through an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/adityapgowda/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Project.xlsb">Dataset</a>

## Question (KPIs) 
What is the total number of casualties reported in the dataset?
Which vehicle types are associated with the highest casualty rates?
What are the monthly trends in casualties over the years analyzed?
What is the distribution of accidents between urban and rural areas?
How do light conditions (daylight vs. darkness) affect the number of accidents and casualties?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/adityapgowda/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20accident%20project%20screeenshot.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Gathered a comprehensive dataset with 23 columns on road accidents, ensuring relevance through variables like Accident Severity, Vehicle Type, Weather Conditions, and Road Type.
- Conducted thorough cleaning to address missing values and inconsistencies, standardizing formats, converting categorical variables to numeric, and creating new attributes such as 'Year' and 'Month'.
- Used Excel pivot tables to analyze key performance indicators and trends, followed by the development of an interactive dashboard featuring various charts to facilitate dynamic exploration of road safety insights for stakeholders.

## Project Insights
Key Factors Influencing Accidents: The analysis identified critical factors contributing to road accidents, including vehicle type, weather conditions, and road surface conditions, which can help target effective interventions.
Trends and Disparities: The project uncovered trends in accident severity linked to specific weather conditions and highlighted disparities between urban and rural areas, with urban locations experiencing more frequent accidents while rural areas faced more severe outcomes.
Patterns and Visualization: Monthly and daily patterns of accidents were analyzed, revealing peak times for incidents, while an interactive dashboard was developed to provide stakeholders with visual insights, enhancing data-driven decision-making for road safety initiatives.
## Final Conclusion:
The "Road Accident Data Analysis" project analyzed a detailed dataset to identify key factors influencing road accidents, such as vehicle type and weather conditions, while highlighting urban-rural trends and timing patterns. An interactive dashboard was created to provide stakeholders with visual insights for informed decision-making. Overall, the project emphasizes the importance of data in shaping effective road safety policies and initiatives
