 # Road-Accident-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective 
The Road Accident Data Analysis project is to identify key factors influencing road accidents and uncover trends related to accident frequency and severity. The project aims to provide data-driven insights and recommendations for improving road safety through an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/adityapgowda/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Project.xlsb">Dataset</a>

## Question (KPIs) 
What is the total number of casualties reported in the dataset?
Which vehicle types are associated with the highest casualty rates?
What are the monthly trends in casualties over the years analyzed?
What is the distribution of accidents between urban and rural areas?
How do light conditions (daylight vs. darkness) affect the number of accidents and casualties?

## Process
- Gathered a comprehensive dataset with 23 columns on road accidents, ensuring relevance through variables like Accident Severity, Vehicle Type, Weather Conditions, and Road Type.
- Conducted thorough cleaning to address missing values and inconsistencies, standardizing formats, converting categorical variables to numeric, and creating new attributes such as 'Year' and 'Month'.
- Used Excel pivot tables to analyze key performance indicators and trends, followed by the development of an interactive dashboard featuring various charts to facilitate dynamic exploration of road safety insights for stakeholders.
